# Project Name
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled 
wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. 
This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
The company wants to know:




## Table of Contents
Need to find the variables imacting the demand for the shared bikes
Conclusing about the factors
technology used like Multilinear regress, RFE 

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
