# Project Name
> In this assignment, you will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 


## Table of Contents
* [General Info] : To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
 A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
* [Technologies Used](#convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. )
* [Conclusions](#used class imbalance using augmentor technique to get the final model)
* [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements)

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 : Include technique of Augmentor to add the more images for train dataset
- Conclusion 2 : Used augmentor to add more images to improve the class imbalance using augmentor technique to get the final model from the analysis
